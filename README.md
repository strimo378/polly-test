This repository aims to enable ISL usage within an Eclipse RCP application.

## Versioning and releases

- Keep bundle `Bundle-Version`, feature `feature.xml`, and p2 `category.xml` versions aligned using the same SemVer base (e.g., `0.1.0`) plus the `.qualifier` suffix for OSGi artifacts.
- Tag releases with `vX.Y.Z` (for example, `v0.1.0`) to match the SemVer base used across bundles, features, and the p2 site.
